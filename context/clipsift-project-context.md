# ClipSift — Project Context

## Project status

- **Status:** v0.1.0 Alpha Windows GitHub pre-release preparation; verified ZIP details recorded, publication pending
- **Created for:** Google Cloud × NVIDIA GTC Berlin 2026 Golden Ticket challenge
- **Submission deadline:** 10 September 2026
- **Owner:** Adam Johnston
- **Primary development platform:** Windows 11
- **Primary desktop GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti
- **Additional development hardware:** Windows laptops with differing NVIDIA GPUs and VRAM capacities

## v0.1.0 Alpha release milestone

- **Milestone:** Prepare the repository and supporting documentation for the first public GitHub pre-release, `v0.1.0 Alpha`.
- **Packaging status:** A PyInstaller onedir/windowed build pipeline and release ZIP exist. A final branded build check, real packaged-EXE inference test, and basic clean-machine test remain unverified in this documentation pass.
- **Branding status:** Branded application icons, header/watermark assets, and GUI controls are present. The final branded package and release screenshots still need to be produced and verified.
- **Distribution details:** The unsigned portable Windows ZIP is [ClipSift-0.1.0-win64.zip](https://downloads.adamj.link/clipsift/v0.1.0/ClipSift-0.1.0-win64.zip), 2,876,584,258 bytes (2.68 GiB), SHA-256 `ce3380b629086c00930928d0038e73f805d1a57f93794ebaafd95d6a1e6bd525` ([checksum file](https://downloads.adamj.link/clipsift/v0.1.0/ClipSift-0.1.0-win64.zip.sha256)). Gemma downloads separately through Hugging Face and is not included in the ZIP; credentials are not redistributed.
- **Release checks still open:** Verify the final branded package with real packaged-EXE inference and a basic clean-machine test, tag `v0.1.0`, publish the GitHub pre-release, and verify the public download/setup journey.
- **Future website:** A later GitHub Pages site will provide the product overview, setup/model guidance, privacy and limitation disclosures, screenshots, demo, FAQ, troubleshooting, and release/download links. Its plan is in `docs/github-pages-plan.md`; no website is being built for this milestone.

## One-sentence summary

ClipSift is a privacy-conscious CCTV review assistant that uses AI and GPU inference to find video clips likely to contain a person, reducing hours of footage to a short review queue.

## The problem

Home CCTV systems can generate many short clips, but manually watching every recording is slow and repetitive. Most clips may contain no useful activity.

The current CCTV camera typically creates clips approximately two minutes long. Frame selection must therefore cover the complete readable duration rather than only the beginning.

ClipSift is intended to perform the first review pass. It samples frames from a folder of recordings, flags likely human activity, and creates a clear report showing which clips should be checked manually.

It is a **triage and review tool**, not an autonomous security decision system.

## Core user workflow

1. The user selects a folder containing CCTV clips.
2. ClipSift reads each supported video without changing the original.
3. Representative frames are sampled at configurable intervals.
4. An open visual AI model assesses whether a person is likely visible.
5. Results from multiple frames are combined to reduce one-frame false positives.
6. Each clip is classified as:
   - **Person Detected**
   - **Needs Review**
   - **No Person Detected**
7. The app produces a review queue, evidence frames, timestamps and a CSV report.

## Competition relevance

The project is being developed alongside the Google Cloud and NVIDIA learning pathways, particularly **Intro to Inference: How to Run AI Models on a GPU**.

The competition requires entrants to build and document something new using Google Cloud and NVIDIA technology with an open model such as Gemma, Nemotron or Cosmos. Entries are judged equally on:

1. Technical innovation
2. Effective use of NVIDIA and Google Cloud technology
3. Potential impact or usefulness
4. Quality of documentation and presentation

ClipSift addresses these areas through a practical end-user problem, open-model visual inference, local and cloud GPU execution, measurable benchmarking, and public documentation.

## Technology direction

### Core application

- Python 3.11
- OpenCV for reading videos and extracting frames
- Pillow where image handling or thumbnails require it
- A simple command-line MVP first
- A Phase 1 Windows desktop GUI using ttkbootstrap, backed by the same scan service as the CLI
- PyInstaller for a later portable Windows release

### Open model

- A vision-capable **Gemma 3** model is the intended competition model.
- Gemma must perform a meaningful visual-analysis task rather than being mentioned only for branding.
- Model responses should be requested in a small structured format and validated before use.
- Gemma provides visual observations only. ClipSift deterministically derives whether human review is required and ignores any model-generated review decision.

Example internal response:

```json
{
  "person_status": "present",
  "assessment_confidence": "high",
  "description": "One person walking beside a parked vehicle"
}
```

The current preferred schema uses `person_status` (`present`, `absent`, or `uncertain`), `assessment_confidence`, and `description`. Present, uncertain, malformed, and low-confidence results require review; absent medium/high-confidence results do not.

### Verified local inference milestone

An initial controlled two-image smoke test completed on an RTX 3060 Laptop GPU using `google/gemma-3-4b-it` with BitsAndBytes 4-bit NF4:

- Person image: person near a fence observed, 8.439 seconds, 3.15 GiB peak allocated GPU memory.
- Empty image: no person observed, with car, fence and houses described, 9.806 seconds, 3.15 GiB peak allocated GPU memory.

These are initial controlled smoke-test results, not a general accuracy benchmark. The single-video smoke-test command loads Gemma once and reuses it across up to 12 selected frames by default. Hybrid selection combines full-timeline coverage with spaced high-motion candidates from a lightweight OpenCV pass. Motion only prioritises frames and is never considered person detection; Gemma makes the visual observation and ClipSift code makes the review decision.

### Phase 2 desktop interface

The local Windows ttkbootstrap GUI launches with `python -m clipsift.gui` or the installed `clipsift-gui` entry point. It uses a worker thread for the shared folder-scan service and a thread-safe event queue for main-thread Tk updates. One Gemma instance is reused across all videos in a scan. Cooperative cancellation preserves completed rows and reports. GUI packaging as an executable remains a later stage.

Phase 2 adds trigger-matched evidence for Person Detected and Needs Review results, an aspect-preserving evidence preview, safe Windows open actions, non-destructive result filters, subtle textual colour coding, a collapsible activity log, scan-state indicators, and persisted preferences. Preferences are stored outside Git at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClipSift\settings.json`. Original recordings remain untouched; only copies of flagged/review clips and generated evidence/report files are written to the selected output folder.

### Phase 3 desktop readiness

Phase 3 refines the dark technical interface and adds an offline **System Check** for Python/runtime imports, PyTorch, CUDA, selected GPU, VRAM, BitsAndBytes, Hugging Face authentication, the selected Gemma checkpoint, and local model-cache presence. It never loads or downloads Gemma. A lightweight worker-thread preflight blocks scans only for genuine readiness failures such as an explicitly requested unavailable GPU, missing required runtime support, an unauthenticated and uncached model, unreadable input, or an unwritable output folder. The GUI links to fixed project/help and Gemma model pages but never requests, displays, or stores Hugging Face tokens.

The privacy statement remains: **Video is processed locally and original footage is never modified.**

### Phase 4A local Windows packaging

ClipSift has a reproducible PyInstaller 6.16.0 onedir/windowed build driven by `ClipSift.spec` and `scripts/build-windows.ps1`. Onedir is retained for transparent, predictable handling of the large PyTorch/CUDA, torchvision, Transformers, OpenCV, Accelerate and BitsAndBytes runtime. UPX is disabled. A build-only custom hook includes the CPU and build-matching CUDA 11.8 BitsAndBytes libraries without unrelated CUDA, ROCm or XPU backends. The application version remains authoritative in `clipsift.__version__` and supplies package and Windows executable metadata.

The package contains neither Gemma weights nor Hugging Face credentials/cache, private/test videos, ClipSift tests, scan output, or preferences. It uses the user's normal Hugging Face cache/authentication and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClipSift\settings.json`. The build script runs source tests, a bounded non-interactive packaged import/offline-diagnostic check, ZIP creation and SHA-256 generation. Packaged diagnostics never load Gemma and therefore do not establish packaged GPU inference; that remains a manual RTX smoke check. The build is unsigned and is not an installer or public release. Deleting the application folder does not delete the separate model cache or user preferences.

The final implementation must use an exact Gemma checkpoint that genuinely supports image input and fits the available environment. The README must record the exact model name, model licence and runtime configuration actually tested. Do not invent these details in advance.

### NVIDIA

- Run local inference using Adam's primary desktop RTX 3070 Ti where practical.
- Detect devices at runtime across desktop and laptop development computers; no GPU model is hard-coded.
- Use the memory-conscious `safe` preset for lower-VRAM hardware, including 4-bit CUDA inference.
- Provide a CPU fallback with an honest warning that it may be slower.
- Record the actual GPU name and runtime details in benchmark output.
- A later optimisation experiment may use NVIDIA TensorRT, but this must not be presented as implemented until tested.

### Google Cloud

- Run the same or equivalent inference workload on a Google Cloud instance with an NVIDIA GPU.
- The intended comparison target is an NVIDIA L4 GPU, subject to quota and availability.
- Use only staged, synthetic, public-domain or explicitly consented test footage for cloud testing.
- If Cloud Storage is used, uploaded test data should be temporary and its handling documented.
- Record the exact Google Cloud service and GPU configuration actually used.

## Intended competition benchmark

Compare the same labelled test set across applicable environments:

1. CPU baseline
2. Local NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti
3. Google Cloud NVIDIA GPU

Record only real measurements:

- Number of clips processed
- Total duration of source footage
- Number of frames analysed
- Total processing time
- Average inference time
- Approximate processed frames per second
- Correctly flagged clips
- False positives
- False negatives
- Reduction in footage requiring manual review

Never add estimated or fabricated benchmark results to the app, website, README or competition entry.

## MVP scope

The first working version should:

- Accept a folder of `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov` and `.mkv` files.
- Sample frames without loading whole videos into memory.
- Make the sampling interval configurable.
- Use the selected Gemma visual model to assess sampled frames.
- Combine multiple assessments into a clip-level result.
- Copy flagged clips into output folders while preserving originals.
- Save the strongest relevant evidence frame when available.
- Produce `report.csv` and `benchmark.json`.
- Display progress and handle cancellation safely.
- Use CUDA automatically when available.
- Fail clearly and safely when a video, model response or dependency is invalid.

Suggested output structure:

```text
ClipSift Results/
├── Person Detected/
├── Needs Review/
├── Evidence Frames/
├── report.csv
└── benchmark.json
```

## Privacy, safety and accuracy boundaries

ClipSift must:

- Never implement facial recognition.
- Never attempt to identify a person.
- Never infer identity, intent, criminality or personal characteristics.
- Never describe an automated result as proof.
- Never delete, move or modify original recordings.
- Process footage locally by default where possible.
- Require deliberate action before any cloud upload.
- Clearly explain that low light, reflections, weather, obstruction and compression may cause mistakes.
- Present every result as an aid for human review.

Private CCTV recordings, extracted evidence frames, model caches, credentials and local result folders must be excluded from Git.

## Explicit non-goals for the competition MVP

Do not add these before the basic workflow is working and documented:

- Facial recognition
- Live camera feeds
- Continuous surveillance
- Automatic police or security alerts
- Behaviour or threat prediction
- Number-plate recognition
- Cloud accounts or user authentication
- Mobile applications
- Remote footage storage
- Automatic deletion of empty clips
- A complex video editor
- A large polished desktop interface
- Multiple object-detection categories
